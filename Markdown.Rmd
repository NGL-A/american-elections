Once every 4 year one of the most relevant political events in the world takes place in the United States: the election of the American President. It is much more than just a day: this time consists in months and months of preparations (campaigns, public speeches, sponsors...), from which data scientists are able to collect great quatities of data to be studied and shaped in order to produce statistics.

The data set we chose is named "Election, COVID, and Demographic Data by County" and it collects a various amount of information which is related to the 2016 Clinton-Trump and the 2020 Trump-Biden elections. The original file consist of 4.867 observations divided in 51 variables which are:

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
