How to connect RStudio to GitHub:
  1. Edit "main.R"
  2. On "Git" section (upper right) a new "main.R" will appear (if it's not there it means you didn't change anything from the previous script)
  3. Install usethis package and the in the console input: usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "your_name", user.email = "your_mail")
  4. Select this new "main.R" (point 3) and commit it
  5. After committing the file you need to make the change effective with "Git push"
  6. Git push (green â†‘ arrow) it R will ask you your Github account username and then a password
  7. The password is a token you generated (imho 6 months validity should be good) from here "https://github.com/settings/tokens"
  8. I selected all "repo", but choose for yourself what use might be most suitable for you
